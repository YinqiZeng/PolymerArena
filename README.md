**Benchmarking Multi-Task Graph Learning Models on Polymer Property Prediction**

Paper under consideration at ICML'26

## 📌 Overview

**PolymerArena** is a comprehensive benchmarking framework for evaluating **multi-task graph learning models** applied to **polymer property prediction**. Graph neural networks (GNNs) and related graph-based models have shown strong performance in molecular and materials informatics. PolymerArena systematically evaluates a representative set of such models in a **multi-task learning setting**, establishing reproducible baselines for future research in polymer informatics and machine learning-assisted materials design.
